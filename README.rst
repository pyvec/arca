Arca is a library for running Python functions (callables) from git repositories in various states of isolation.
Arca can also cache the results of these callables using `dogpile.cache <https://dogpilecache.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Getting started
***************

Glossary
++++++++

* **Arca** - name of the library. When written as ``Arca``, the main interface class is being referenced.
* **Task** - definition of the function (callable), consists of a reference to the object and arguments.
* **Backend** - a way of running tasks.

Installation
++++++++++++

Requirements
------------

* Python >= 3.6

Requirements for certain backends:

* `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ (for `Docker Backend <https://arca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends.html#docker>`_
  and `Vagrant Backend <https://arca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends.html#vagrant>`_)
* `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`_ (for the `Vagrant Backend <https://arca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends.html#vagrant>`_)

Installation
------------

To install the last stable version:

.. code-block:: bash

  python -m pip install arca

If you want to use the Docker backend:

.. code-block:: bash

  python -m  pip install arca[docker]

Or if you want to use the Vagrant backend:

.. code-block:: bash

  python -m pip install arca[vagrant]

Or if you wish to install the upstream version:

.. code-block:: bash

  python -m pip install git+https://github.com/mikicz/arca.git#egg=arca
  python -m pip install git+https://github.com/mikicz/arca.git#egg=arca[docker]
  python -m pip install git+https://github.com/mikicz/arca.git#egg=arca[vagrant]

Example
+++++++

To run a Hello World example you'll only need the ``arca.Arca`` and ``arca.Task`` classes.
``Task`` is used for defining the task that's supposed to be run in the repositories.
``Arca`` takes care of all the settings and provides the basic API for running the tasks.

Let's say we have the following file, called ``hello_world.py``,
in a repository ``https://example.com/hello_word.git``, on branch ``master``.

.. code-block:: python

  def say_hello():
     return "Hello World!"

To call the function using Arca, the following example would do so:

.. code-block:: python

  from arca import Arca, Task

  task = Task("hello_world:say_hello")
  arca = Arca()

  result = arca.run("https://example.com/hello_word.git", "master", task)
  print(result.output)

The code would print ``Hello World!``.
``result`` would be a ``arca.Result`` instance which currently only has one attribute,
``output``, with the output of the function call.
If the task fails, ``arca.exceptions.BuildError`` would be raised.

By default, the `Current Environment Backend <https://arca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends.html#current-environment>`_ is used to run tasks,
which uses the current Python, launching the code in a subprocess. You can learn about backends `here <https://arca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends.html>`_.

Further reading
***************

You can read the full documentation on `Read The Docs <https://arca.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Running tests
**************

To run tests you'll need the optional requirements, Docker and Vagrant. Once you have them and they can be used by
the current user you just need to run:

.. code-block:: bash

  python setup.py test

This will launch the tests and a PEP8 check. The tests will take some time since building the custom
docker images is also tested and vagrant, in general, takes a long time to set up.

Contributing
************

I am developing this library as my bachelor thesis and will be not accepting any PRs at the moment.
